# PHP Foreach Loop and Unset() Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP related to using `unset()` within a `foreach` loop over an array.  Modifying the array during iteration can result in unexpected behavior, particularly when dealing with numerical keys. 

The `bug.php` file showcases the problem, and `bugSolution.php` provides a solution. See the detailed explanation in the files themselves.
